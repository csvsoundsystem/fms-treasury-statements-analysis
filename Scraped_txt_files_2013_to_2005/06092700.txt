1/ The Department of the Treasury began a pilot program for the repurchase of marketable Treasury securities on March 27, 2006.  
In this program, Treasury invests cash not immediately needed for operations of the Government by purchasing Treasury securities 
under an agreement that the seller will repurchase the Treasury securities in 1 or more days.  Between the start of the program 
and September 26, 2006, Treasury reduced the amount of Debt Subject to Limit by the par value of the Treasury securities purchased 
and held by Treasury under the repurchase agreements, less unamortized discount on bills.  Treasury has decided to stop making this
adjustment during the remainder of the pilot program while further consideration is given to the most appropriate way to reflect
