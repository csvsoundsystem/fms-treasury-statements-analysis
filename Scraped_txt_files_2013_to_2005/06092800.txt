1/ The Department of the Treasury began a pilot program for the repurchase of marketable Treasury securities on March 27, 2006.
   In this program, Treasury invests cash not immediately needed for operations of the Government by purchasing Treasury securities 
   under an agreement that the seller will repurchase the Treasury securities in 1 or more days.  Between the start of the program 
   and September 26, 2006, Treasury reduced the amount of Debt Subject to Limit by the par value of the Treasury securities 
   purchased and held by Treasury under the repurchase agreements, less unamortized discount on bills.  Treasury has decided to 
   stop making this adjustment during the remainder of the pilot program while further consideration is given to the most 
   appropriate way to reflect these transactions in the reporting of debt outstanding.  The par value of the Treasury securities 
   held by Treasury under repurchase agreements, less unamortized discount on bills, was $3,929 million.



     This statement summarizes the United States Treasury's cash and debt
     operations for the Federal Government.  Treasury's operating cash is
     maintained in an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and

     sources include:  Federal Reserve Banks, Treasury Regional Financial
     Centers, Internal Revenue Service Centers, Bureau of the Public Debt
     and various electronic systems.  Information is presented on a
     modified cash basis.  Deposits are reflected as received and
