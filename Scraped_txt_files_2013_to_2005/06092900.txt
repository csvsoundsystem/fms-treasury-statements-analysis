1/ The Department of the Treasury began a pilot program for the repurchase 
     of marketable Treasury securities on March 27, 2006. In this program, 
     Treasury invests cash not immediately needed for operations of the Government 
     by purchasing Treasury securities under an agreement that the seller will 
     repurchase the Treasury securities in 1 or more days. Between the start of 
     the program and September 26, 2006 Treasury reduced the amount of Debt Subject 
     to Limit by the par value of the Treasury securities purchased and held by 
     Treasury under the repurchase agreements, less unamortized discount on bills. 
     Treasury has decided to stop making this adjustment during the remainder of 
     the pilot program while further consideration is given to the most appropriate 
     way to reflect these transactions in the reporting of debt outstanding. 
     The par value of the Treasury securities held by Treasury under repurchase 
     agreements, less unamortized discount on bills, was $4,077 million.   

2/ Does not include $38 million offset by FMS for the month of September 2006,
     and $2,774 million for the fiscal year-to-date for Treasury Offset Program
     against Tax Refunds issued.
